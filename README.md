# Notice

This project is under construction and untested. The work in here will not have
a high level of polish or documentation. The project will likely see some
improvement and the documentation will come once the core features are settled.

This project will (not likely) be ported to OCaml and custom scripting language if I find this project to be useful enough.

# Overview

PyForeman is a package that allows for easy generation of shell scripts for building projects. The project is not widely useful, but there may be someone out there who doesn't want to have make or other build tools as dependancies?

The generated scripts support parallelism at each dependancy level. Dependacy cycles are checked for at run time.

It also uses a cute construction site analogy for building programs.

# Motivation

For one of my classes I am not allowed to use Makefiles, only Bash or BAT scripts. Because I don't feel like actually writing bash/BAT scripts by hand, I'm writing this project as a framework to make it look like I did.

# Structure

To be expanded upon.
